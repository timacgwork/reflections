When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working on a project with a group of people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you are working on a project, you would not want the code to change
without your knowledge.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are copies of repositories done on GitHub.
Clones are copies of repositories from GitHub to your local system or your localsystem to GitHub.
Branches are divergent changes to code on your local system.

Fork - Start with anothers repository on GitHub.
Clone - You want to use another's repository but not save to GitHub.
Branch - You want to try experiments or new functionality to working code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You will know when your local repository is out of sync with the remote repository without internet access.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
To collaborate without Git/GitHub I would need to send zip files.
Once you understand Git/GitHub, I think Git would be an easier way to collaborate.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
You would want to make changes in a separate branch when there is the possibility of breaking production code.
Not sure how to answer the second question.
