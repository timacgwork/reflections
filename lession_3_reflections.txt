When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working on a project with a group of people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you are working on a project, you would not want the code to change
without your knowledge.
